        <p>The following was an assignment for a Texts and Cultures of Science course taken at Temple University. The goal of the paper was to discuss the ways in which popular science (that which reaches a broad, even non-scientific audience) differs from works that are in fact intended soley for the scientific community. Two articles in particular were chosen. Close reads of each of the articles were performed and word choice was compared and contrasted between the two. Larger implications for each was also theorized based on the given information.</p>
