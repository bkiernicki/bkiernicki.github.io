            <h1>Let Me Introduce Myself</h1>
            <p>Hi, my name is Bridget Kiernicki and I’m currently pursuing a B.S. in Biology as well as a minor in English at Temple University. I’m set to graduate in December 2019 and hope to further my education with a master’s degree. What drove me towards a degree in biology was my love for all things living. When I’m not in class or studying, you can usually find me outside immersed in nature or caring for my animals. Throughout the years, there's never been a shortage of animals (or plants for that matter) in my household. I've had many indoor and outdoor cats, a few dogs, a couple of geckos, a pair of red earred sliders, and plenty of goldfish who've survived to be over 10 years old. Around my community, I've helped rescue many baby birds and young squirrels, and even a fox who was hit by a car. From a young age, I've idolized the likes of Jane Goodall, Jeff Corwin, and Steve Irwin as well as all the important work they've done in wildlife conservation. I always dreamed of someday doing the same kind of work they've done.  As someone who is also passionate about wildlife, I see it only fitting that I try to pursue my dream of entering the field of wildlife biology. Honestly, there’s no better way I can think of to give back to the animals and ecosystems I love than to dedicate my life to their conservation.</p>
