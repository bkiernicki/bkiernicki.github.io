            <p>The following research piece was submitted as an individual project for a Primate Behavior course taken at Temple University. The subjects were gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) of varying ages and sexes which were located at the Philadelphia zoo. The gorillasâ€™ actions were observed and marked down in real time in order to make larger generalizations about their behavior. The paper contains an ethogram (which a catalog of behavior) and an ad libitum (which lists and defines all possible behaviors). My role was to observe, note, and analyze the data.</p>

            <p>This file contains a powerpoint summary of a scienitfic article entitled "Kinship, parental manipulation and the evoutionary origin of eusociality" (Kapheim et al 2015). It was submitted as a group project for an Animal Behavior course taken at Temple University. The subject in this article is the tropical sweat bee, Megalopta genalis. The main goal of the research within the article was to establish whether eusociality evolved via the daughter's genes (i.e. her willingness to help) or as a result of the mother's genes (maternal manipulation).</p>

            <p>Dementia Care is a simulation website created specifically for use by dementia patients and their families. It was part of an individual project for a Texts and Cultures of Science course taken at Temple University. The intention was to extract information from sites used by medical professionals and translate it into laymans terms with a more empathetic approach intended for a broader audience (in particular the patients and family of the patients) without compromising the effectiveness and accuracy of the content. </p>

            <p>The following was an assignment for a Texts and Cultures of Science course taken at Temple University. The goal of the paper was to discuss the ways in which popular science (that which reaches a broad, even non-scientific audience) differs from works that are in fact intended soley for the scientific community. Two articles in particular were chosen. Close reads of each of the articles were performed and word choice was compared and contrasted between the two. Larger implications for each was also theorized based on the given information. </p>

            <p>The drawings contained within this file were submitted as an individual project for an Intoduction to Biology I lab taken at Temple University. These are a few examples of the many drawings that were required throughout the semester. Some actual images taken of slides were included where applicable to allow for comparison. My role was to observe, draw, label, and name each specimen.</p>

            <p>The following paper is representative of some of my work as an English minor. It contains a brief analysis of Robert Frost's "Birches" conducted for an Interpreting Literature Course taken at Temple University. It focuses on the imagery of the birch trees, the contrasts of the black and white coloration of the trunk, the tendency of the trees to sway back and forth, as well as their larger implications about life itself.</p>
