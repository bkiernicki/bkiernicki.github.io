        <h1>Zoo Project: A Behavioral Analysis of Gorillas</h1>

        <p>The following research piece was submitted as an individual project for a Primate Behavior course taken at the Temple University. The subjects were gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) of varying ages and sexes which were located at the Philadelphia zoo. The gorillasâ€™ actions were observed and marked down in real time in order to make larger generalizations about their behavior. The paper contains an ethogram (which a catalog of behavior) and an ad libitum (which lists and defines all possible behaviors). My role was to observe, note, and analyze the data.</p>
